## 3. Implementation Notes

The website was built using the WordPress CMS and hosted on a cPanel server. The implementation focuses on leveraging powerful, well-supported plugins to achieve the required functionality efficiently and reliably.

*   **CMS Platform:** WordPress
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   **Events Management:** The **"The Events Calendar"** plugin was used to handle all event-related functionality. This plugin automatically creates a custom post type for events, provides fields for date, location, and registration URLs, and generates the main events archive page at the `/events` slug.
    *   **Homepage Event List:** The dynamic list of the 3 most recent upcoming events on the homepage is generated using the shortcode: `[tribe_events view="list" limit="3"]`.
    *   **Contact Form:** The bonus requirement for a contact form was met using the **"Contact Form 7"** plugin. A dedicated "Contact Us" page hosts the form.
    *   **Editor Experience:** The **"Classic Editor"** plugin was enabled to maintain a straightforward and familiar content editing experience.

*   **Content Structure:**
    *   **Homepage:** A static page set under "Settings > Reading". It contains the hero content and the events shortcode.
    *   **Events Page:** Automatically generated by "The Events Calendar" at `/events`. It lists all events chronologically and includes built-in pagination.
    *   **Sample Content:** Three sample events have been created for Nairobi, Kenya, to demonstrate the site's functionality.
